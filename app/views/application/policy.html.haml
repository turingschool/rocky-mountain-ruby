    %h1 Enforcement
    %p Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    %p If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.
    %p We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.
